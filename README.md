# Tech Talk

  ## Description
  Tech Talk is a tech blog in which users can create accounts to post and comment on each other's content, thanks to MySQL, Sequelize, and Handlebars. I know there's a lot of work to do yet, but the assignment's already a month late as it is, I think I'd rather have it turned in than 100% working.
